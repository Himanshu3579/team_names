Solution:

An Arduino based Bluetooth controlled street light system.
Our model detects any Bluetooth signal in its proximity.
Hence after detecting the Bluetooth signal it switches on the street lights. 
After the Bluetooth signal strength is below a certain value the lights turn off automatically after a certain period of time.
What user has to do is just to switch on Bluetooth and street light automatically lights up his way.
