GO FIT


We have built a web-based application, to help motivate and energize the individuals to perform exercise

We have a secure login for the user, along with which, we could even send invites to our friends through email, to join the application

This app works as a combination of a tracking and motivational guide

We have a dashboard which gives all the information regarding the user including the points he has scored

The user can add new activites along with the duration he has done those activities, which helps to calculate the no. of calories burnt in the user, which thus helps us calculate the score

If the total points go above a certain threshold, his/her level increases and he gets more points for the same

He can also challenge his friend to different activities, which thus can enable both him and his friend to motivate themselves due to the competitive spirit

He can also create events like going for a cycle ride at a particulat place and time, which thus motivates everyone to come out and enjoy. Similarly, he can join these kind of events, to get involved in the fun

He also gets daily activities to be accomplished, which helps him increase his points to a higher level and keeps him fit

Once his overall challenges accepted go above a certain mark, he is awarded with different badges

Also, we have a streak maintenance, wherein one can continually exercise each day and keep up with his friends on the social front

There is even a leaderboard to see whoâ€™s at the top of the points table and try and topple the leader, by outperforming him.
